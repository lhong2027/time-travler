        As we’ve previously mentioned, the evolution of the web relies on two aspects: technology and concept. In theory,
			then, we are in control of where it goes next. If the desire and the design and content of the web moves toward
			openness and decentralization, the concept just needs the technology to support it. In this way, you could view
			the adoption and use of Web 3.0 applications as a form of revolution, not just evolution. When users became 
			participants in Web 2.0, it created problems, such as data collection. However, it allowed more people into the
			system, which means they could also provide solutions to these issues. This evolution will take time as it
			involves the infrastructure of the web, which means it might not feel different, but the effect will be significant.
			There’s a chance that Web 3.0 will give us more control and more time in our days. It could also change existing 
			business models, bringing tokens and unrestricted currencies into popular use. The impact of these changes has the
			potential to spread far beyond the internet and into our daily lives.
