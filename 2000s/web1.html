        The first iteration is often referred to as the read-only version. It’s defined by how people used and still do usethe web. Its main function was a source of information, and the majority of users would be searching for content and reading it. In this iteration, there are authors who create the pages, and there are the users who ‘surf’ the web and consume the content. Websites in this version are fairly static spaces, like an encyclopedia, a shop window, or a catalog, where people can browse and read. The critical distinction is that the majority of users are reading and not adding to the information. The HTML pages add the ability to display text and later images and videos, but there was no way for site visitors to change that data. Many websites still function in this way, which is why it’s crucial to understand the overlapping nature of the different iterations.The initial groundbreaking concept of the web that we still marvel at today is that it increases your reach. An author of a page can present their content to people all over the world, shaking off the constraints of having a physical location. This element is still beneficial, which is why eCommerce sites still function in a read-only Web 1.0 format. There is some interaction from the user, but the data is set by the site creator.
