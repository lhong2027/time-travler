    The Internet began as a research project in the 1960s. There were many pioneers in research, science, and technology that paved the way. The concept of a ‘galactic network’ of computers was put into practice by the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) when they created a prototype that sent the first message from a computer at UCLAto one in Stanford University in 1969. In the 1970s, protocols were developed, including Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP and IP), which might sound familiar. They were used by ARPANET in the 80s to extend the network, and so the internet was born. However, it wasn’t until the 1990s that it took on the form that we have come to know today. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee described the concept of the Web, a way of accessing data through websites. Later, search engines and the first websites appeared. The code for the World Wide Web was published using the internet, and through input and collaboration, it began to take shape.
