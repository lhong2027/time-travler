        We’re in an exciting phase as we transition to Web 3.0, even though that concept is not clearly defined yet.
        By looking at the invention of the internet and the web, we can see that things have come a long way. Last week,
        we announced that Brave browser now allows users to natively browse .crypto websites on desktop and Android.
        This is a huge step toward onboarding the masses onto Web 3.0 and is a testament to how quickly this space
        is moving. In the last decade, the growth of devices, websites, and applications has risen to an almost
        unmanageable level. While we haven’t hit maximum capacity, the expansion of the web needs to be matched by 
        our laws, social actions, and way of life. Web 3.0 could be an opportunity for work to be done to the
         infrastructure of the online world and our daily lives to align them more closely.
