			Throughout this article, we’ve been referring to the versions of the web as iterations. This terminology
			is common in many industries, but especially in technology. Think of the 4G moving to 5G and the release 
			of the iPhone X; each one suggests something bigger and better,or at least a new way of doing things. 
			We might be moving into the era of 3.0, but that doesn’t mean that the way we used to use the web will
			become obsolete. Each version adds to the functionality rather than changing it completely. That means
			some websites will still exist as places to browse and read; others will have that option plus the ability
			to interact and contribute. On top of that, machines could also read that data and execute tasks, all while
			we avoid letting our data become a commodity. When machines can better understand what is written on the web,
			we’ll have more efficient search engines, enhanced connectivity with different objects, and fewer people
			seeking to control the data. Other benefits could include better customer support through chatbots and more
			helpful and targeted advertising.
