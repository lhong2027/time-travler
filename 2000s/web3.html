        The newest iteration hasn’t fully arrived yet. However, a fuzzy outline and speculation of what Web 3.0 could be are slowly appearing. Now we return to the  idea of a ‘Semantic Web’ that Berners-Lee had envisioned. In this version, the machine will talk to the machine enabling daily tasks, mechanisms, or activities to be handled by devices. This evolution moves from read-only and read-write to read-write-execute, meaning that content could be read by software to perform a service or a task. We’re already on the path with the increase in peer-2-peer (P2P) concepts, such as blockchain. Other signs of the new version of the web include virtual reality, open-source software, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The latter includes devices that aren’t computers, which interact on a network. They could be smart home products, sensors, and security systems and allow for automation, monitoring, and remote control. One of the biggest hopes for Web 3.0 as it’s formed is that it will bring back openness and devolve control through a decentralized network. As with ryptocurrencies like Ethereum, no single entity is in control, but actions must follow protocols, are recorded, and therefore transparent. 3.0 might look to address other issues that have come about during the evolution of the web. These include an excess of advertising, data harvesting, breaches, and censorhip.
