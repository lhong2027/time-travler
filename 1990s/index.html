				The Internet began as a research project in the 1960s. There were many pioneers in research, science, and technology<br>
				that paved the way. The concept of a ‚Äògalactic network‚Äô of computers was put into practice by the Advanced Research<br>
				Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) when they created a prototype that sent the first message from a computer at UCLA<br>
				to one in Stanford University in 1969. In the 1970s, protocols were developed, including Transmission Control Protocol<br>
				and Internet Protocol (TCP and IP), which might sound familiar. They were used by ARPANET in the 80s to extend the<br>
				network, and so the internet was born. However, it wasn‚Äôt until the 1990s that it took on the form that we have come <br>
				to know today. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee described the concept of the Web, a way of accessing data through websites. <br>
				Later, search engines and the first websites appeared. The code for the World Wide Web was published using the <br>
				internet, and through input and collaboration, it began to take shape.

			From its beginnings as a work of information sharing and collaboration, the web has gone on to keep those purposes<br> 
			at its heart. As a flexible tool and information service, it has been shaped by those that use it, while others have<br>
			harnessed it for their own needs.After its conception, the web evolved. People often refer to those different stages<br>
			of development as iterations one and two, and version three is anticipated. However, others view these alternative<br>
			ways of using it, meaning they can overlap but also expand. The web‚Äôs evolution has relied on technology but also on<br>
			how users interact with it. For it to advance or evolve, we need the capability to make it happen, such as the protocols<br>
			required to create the internet. However, we also need the idea, for example, Tim Berners-Lee conceiving of a way to<br> 
			access data and then making it a reality. While Berners-Lee might have first described websites as places to access<br>
			data, he later went on to talk about the Semantic Web, which was his dream of how it could evolve and be used. <br>
			We have the concept, and the technology is catching up, which is why many anticipate the emergence of web 3.0 in <br>
			the near future. Let‚Äôs look at the three iterations of the web to understand where it started, what we experience now,<br>
			and how that could transform in the coming years.

			The first iteration is often referred to as the read-only version. It‚Äôs defined by how people used and still do use<br>
			the web. Its main function was a source of information, and the majority of users would be searching for content and<br>
			eading it. In this iteration, there are authors who create the pages, and there are the users who ‚Äòsurf‚Äô the web and<br>
			consume the content. Websites in this version are fairly static spaces, like an encyclopedia, a shop window, or a<br>
			catalog, where people can browse and read. The critical distinction is that the majority of users are reading and not<br>
			adding to the information. The HTML pages add the ability to display text and later images and videos, but there was<br>
			no way for site visitors to change that data. Many websites still function in this way, which is why it‚Äôs crucial to <br>
			understand the overlapping nature of the different iterations.The initial groundbreaking concept of the web that we still <br>
			marvel at today is that it increases your reach. An author of a page can present their content to people all over the world, <br>
			shaking off the constraints of having a physical location. This element is still beneficial, which is why eCommerce sites <br>
			still function in a read-only Web 1.0 format. There is some interaction from the user, but the data is set by the site creator.

			Our current iteration is Web 2.0 or the read-write version. It moves on from having the majority of users being<br>
			people who search for and read information. Now, more users are becoming creators and adding to the content on<br>
			the web. The interactions between people on the web increase, and those creations and communications influence<br>
			the landscape. The read-write iteration means more rapid change. The potential, when compared to 1.0, is much <br>
			bigger as each user/creator is leaving their mark on what the web is and what it could become. Examples of sites<br>
			that are part of this version include Imgur and YouTube, which get their content from user submissions. With the <br>
			level of user participation increasing, the amount of content accessible through the internet expanded considerably.<br>
			Through databases, social media, and forms, people starting to come online to be part of a community, to create, and<br>
			to share instead of just accessing information. While a web full of contributors sounds overwhelmingly positive,<br> 
			Web 2.0 came with challenges too. More interaction meant that people were providing their information online. These<br>
			details became commodities. Disparities between large companies that hosted sites and their content and the people<br>
			who interacted with them emerged as transparency decreased. Access points expanded too. Instead of only search engines<br>
			and browsers, social media sites and applications created small spaces that gave us a doorway to the web, but only to<br>
			specific content. Introducing the concept of iteration 2.0 started people wondering where the web would go next.

			The newest iteration hasn‚Äôt fully arrived yet. However, a fuzzy outline and speculation of what Web 3.0 could be <br>
			are slowly appearing. Now we return to the  idea of a ‚ÄòSemantic Web‚Äô that Berners-Lee had envisioned. In this <br>
			version, the machine will talk to the machine enabling daily tasks, mechanisms, or activities to be handled by <br>
			devices. This evolution moves from read-only and read-write to read-write-execute, meaning that content could be read by<br>
			software to perform a service or a task. We‚Äôre already on the path with the increase in peer-2-peer (P2P) concepts, <br>
			such as blockchain. Other signs of the new version of the web include virtual reality, open-source software, and the<br>
			Internet of Things (IoT). The latter includes devices that aren‚Äôt computers, which interact on a network. They could<br> 
			be smart home products, sensors, and security systems and allow for automation, monitoring, and remote control. <br>
			One of the biggest hopes for Web 3.0 as it‚Äôs formed is that it will bring back openness and devolve control through <br>
			a decentralized network. As with ryptocurrencies like Ethereum, no single entity is in control, but actions must follow<br>
			protocols, are recorded, and therefore transparent. 3.0 might look to address other issues that have come about during the<br>
			evolution of the web. These include an excess of advertising, data harvesting, breaches, and censorship.

			As we‚Äôve previously mentioned, the evolution of the web relies on two aspects: technology and concept. In theory,<br>
			then, we are in control of where it goes next. If the desire and the design and content of the web moves toward<br>
			openness and decentralization, the concept just needs the technology to support it. In this way, you could view<br>
			the adoption and use of Web 3.0 applications as a form of revolution, not just evolution. When users became <br>
			participants in Web 2.0, it created problems, such as data collection. However, it allowed more people into the<br>
			system, which means they could also provide solutions to these issues. This evolution will take time as it<br>
			involves the infrastructure of the web, which means it might not feel different, but the effect will be significant.<br>
			There‚Äôs a chance that Web 3.0 will give us more control and more time in our days. It could also change existing <br>
			business models, bringing tokens and unrestricted currencies into popular use. The impact of these changes has the<br>
			potential to spread far beyond the internet and into our daily lives.

			Throughout this article, we‚Äôve been referring to the versions of the web as iterations. This terminology<br>
			is common in many industries, but especially in technology. Think of the 4G moving to 5G and the release <br>
			of the iPhone X; each one suggests something bigger and better,or at least a new way of doing things. <br>
			We might be moving into the era of 3.0, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that the way we used to use the web will<br>
			become obsolete. Each version adds to the functionality rather than changing it completely. That means<br>
			some websites will still exist as places to browse and read; others will have that option plus the ability<br>
			to interact and contribute. On top of that, machines could also read that data and execute tasks, all while<br>
			we avoid letting our data become a commodity. When machines can better understand what is written on the web,<br>
			we‚Äôll have more efficient search engines, enhanced connectivity with different objects, and fewer people<br>
			seeking to control the data. Other benefits could include better customer support through chatbots and more<br>
			helpful and targeted advertising.

			We‚Äôre in an exciting phase as we transition to Web 3.0, even though that concept is not clearly defined yet.<br>
			By looking at the invention of the internet and the web, we can see that things have come a long way. Last week,<br>
			we announced that Brave browser now allows users to natively browse .crypto websites on desktop and Android.<br>
			This is a huge step toward onboarding the masses onto Web 3.0 and is a testament to how quickly this space<br>
			is moving. In the last decade, the growth of devices, websites, and applications has risen to an almost<br>
			unmanageable level. While we haven‚Äôt hit maximum capacity, the expansion of the web needs to be matched by <br>
			our laws, social actions, and way of life. Web 3.0 could be an opportunity for work to be done to the<br>
			 infrastructure of the online world and our daily lives to align them more closely.
